<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for <code>JCoServer</code> start mechanism</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A regression of JCo 3.1.2 compared to version 3.0 was fixed: When disabling a server by invoking
<code>JCoServer.stop()</code>, it was not possible to enable the server again using <code>JCoServer.start()</code>.
In this case the following <code>JCoRuntimeException</code> was thrown: "JCO_ERROR_CONFIGURATION: Unable to start the
server due to wrong configuration: no successful connection to any gateway could be established".
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for <code>JCoServerFactory.getNumberOfServerConnections()</code></b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A regression of JCo 3.1.2 compared to version 3.0 was fixed: When trying to check the number of connections for a
registered server, an exception was thrown, if the passed server had not been started before. Now the number of existing
connections for the key triple of gateway host, gateway service, and program ID can always be fetched - independent
from the server state.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for callbacks to built-in functions</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A regression of JCo 3.1.2 compared to version 3.0 was fixed: When calling a function module that is doing a callback to
the few built-in function modules in JCo, and the back-end is supporting basXML, the invocation failed with a
<code>JCO_ERROR_SYSTEM_FAILURE: Error while parsing bASXML document</code> caused by
<code>JCO_ERROR_XML_PARSER: Unexpected token in parameter %_RFC_DELTA1 of the current BXML document: 'R' at position ...</code>,
when receiving the results because the communication was wrongly adjusted to use basXML, even though the called function
module was not flagged to use basXML.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for initial values of STRING and XSTRING fields</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Up to JCo 3.1.2, the initial value for fields of type STRING and XSTRING was <code>null</code>. Actually, when checking
the initial value in ABAP, this is different. Hence, JCo was corrected to behave the same and to use an emtpy String and
an empty byte array, respectively.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for logon parameter <code>jco.client.use_tls</code></b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<code>jco.client.use_tls</code> is supposed to be an optional logon property defaulting to the secure setting 1.
Previously, it had still to be specified to make a connection work, even if the default value was desired.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for repository roundtrip optimization</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
In case the back-end is known to be new enough, and <code>jco.use_repository_roundtrip_optimization</code> has not been
set to 0, JCo will not check for the existence of <code>RFC_METADATA_GET</code> thus avoiding the need for providing
additional authorizations for the repository user.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Improvement at CPIC keep alive mechanism</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The keep alive mechanism was re-implemented so that it better recognizes corrupt connections and black-hole routers,
but also allows to configure large timeouts which is needed for some scenarios.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for z/OS</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
With JCo 3.1.3 z/OS is supported again. See note SAP note
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2786882">2786882</a>
for the detailed list of supported versions.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for MacOS</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
JCo will now work on MacOS without the need to modify the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, even if network settings will not
allow to resolve the own hostname. See note SAP note
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2942455">2942455</a> for details.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for default values</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Added support for the parameter default values <code>ABAP_TRUE</code>, <code>ABAP_FALSE</code>, and <code>ABAP_UNDEFINED</code>.
Furthermore, unknown variables and constants are now simply ignored instead of treating them as string literals.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for reentrance ticket support</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
With S/4HANA 1909 the technology used for reentrance ticket support has changed. JCo 3.1.3 now supports this new approach.<br/>
<em>Note:</em> This variant of the reentrance ticket needs to be accompanied by the information about the user
(provided by the <code>DestinationDataProvider</code> implementation in property <code>jco.client.user</code>)
that it was created for.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for WebSocket RFC client authentication</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
JCo now supports the usage of a TLS client certificate for logging on at an ABAP system. See the JavaDoc of the new
property <code>jco.client.tls_client_certificate_logon</code> and the new method <code>DestinationDataProvider.getClientCertificate()</code>
for details.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Introduced WebSocket RFC server communication</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
RFC communication is possible also using WebSocket technology instead of the existing CPIC based one. The WebSocket RFC
communication feature was initially shipped with ABAP Platform 1909 (application server ABAP 7.54). With JCo 3.1.3,
outbound communication is now supported as well, i.e. an ABAP system is calling JCo via WebSocket RFC. The ABAP platform

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>General remarks</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
JCo 3.1 is the successor of JCo 3.0. In note <a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2786882">2786882</a>
you can find the JVMs and platforms on which the new version is supported. Please note that some platforms have been
dropped and that the minimum JVM version has been raised to Java 8. JCo 3.1 is supposed to be byte-code compatible to
JCo 3.0 as long as you are not using methods or fields, that have been deprecated in JCo 3.0. Those have been removed
from JCo 3.1. Below you can find a set of the most important new features now supported with JCo 3.1.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for fast serialization</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The RFC runtime of JCo can now serialize the function module data in the fast serialization mode, if the partner system
supports that serialization format as well. Technically, it is a column-based serialization of the data, which has been
shipped initially with application server ABAP 7.51 and has been downported later so that also older systems benefit
from the performance improvements of that serialization. Note <a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2372888">2372888</a>
describes the ABAP system prerequisites.<br/>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>WebSocket RFC client communication</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
RFC communication is possible also using WebSocket technology instead of the existing CPIC based one. The WebSocket RFC
communication feature was initially shipped with ABAP Platform 1909 (application server ABAP 7.54). So far, only client
side communication is supported, i.e. JCo calling an ABAP system. The ABAP platform

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Configuring a high availability registered server</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The registration at a system instead of a single gateway allows to have high availability support for a
<code>JCoServer</code>. Thus, instead of registering only at one specific gateway, a server program can register at all
gateways belonging to a given system identified by the message server (with the possibility to limit the set of
application servers to a logon group). If one application server is shutdown or restarted (e.g. when doing a rolling
kernel update) the <code>JCoServer</code> can still be reached via the remaining gateways.<br/>
Find more details about the new properties in the JavaDoc of <code>ServerDataProvider</code>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Change events for SessionReferenceProvider</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Just like the DataProviders, also the <code>SessionReferenceProvider</code> allows to support events. Thus, connections
and sessions within the JCo runtime are cleaned up immediately whenever a session is terminated. Note that
<code>isSessionAlive()</code> will still be invoked from time to time in order to find zombie sessions that were
not cleaned up properly by session management.<br/>
Find more details in the JavaDoc.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Record conversion to and from JSON</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
All <code>JCoRecords</code> are offering the possibility to efficiently convert their data to a natural JSON representation
(<code>JCoTable</code> is represented as an array, <code>JCoStructures</code> as a JavaScript structure and each field
has the (uppercase) name like in ABAP). Furthermore, it is possible to fill <code>JCoRecords</code> from such documents
with data. Thus it is easily possible to offer simple and short JCo code that interacts with a JavaScript based user interface.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Multitenancy with JCo</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
By default, JCo 3.1 is still running in a single tenant mode. However, the JCo runtime has been extended to support
multi-tenant environments. By implementing and registering a <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ext.TenantProvider</code>, it is
possible to isolate <code>JCoDestinations</code> (and, certainly, the associated connections), <code>JCoRepositorys</code>,
and other important runtime artifacts for different tenants.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for new ABAP Types</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The following new ABAP type is now supported by JCo: <code>UTCLONG</code>.<br/>
Find more details in the JavaDoc.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for configuring a load balancing destination with sticky behavior</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Some JCo applications need to make sure that once a communication started with an application server, the same application
server is used for all requests afterwards, even if the executed requests are stateless. This allows efficient usage of
cached data and database buffers on application server side. Hence, JCo introduces the destination configuration parameter
<code>jco.client.sticky</code>, which specifies whether the pool should get sticky to the application server. After an
idle time period, during which the application does not execute any requests, a different application server could be used
for further requests, depending on the current load determined by the message server.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>MessageServer info</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The package <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ms</code> allows to interact with a message server and to get information about the
application servers and groups in that system. The <code>JCoMessageServerFactory</code> fetches the necessary physical
information for the message server from the registered <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ext.MessageServerDataProvider</code> that
is fitting to the given logical message server.<br/>
Find more details in the JavaDoc.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>CPIC performance improvement in WAN scenarios</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When executing requests in WAN scenarios and exchanging large data amounts, the streaming feature of CPIC allows to send
data without waiting for acknowledgements for each data package. Thus, latency effects and overall execution times are
dramatically decreased. JCo turns on CPIC streaming automatically, if the partner system supports it as well.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Adjustable socket buffer size</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
JCo allows to set the low-level socket buffer size via JCo property <code>jco.ni.socket_buffer_size</code>, which allows
to tune network performance.<br/>
Find more details about the parameter in the JavaDoc and in SAP notes
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2047230">2047230</a> and
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2304840">2304840</a>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>JCo repository roundtrip optmization</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
With JCo 3.1, the default for JCo property <code>jco.use_repository_roundtrip_optimization</code> changed to 1, which
means that if the backend supports it, the network roundtrip optimized function module <code>RFC_METADATA_GET</code>
is used for better performance when looking up metadata.<br/>
As a consequence you might need to adopt the authorization profile for your repository user ID as described in SAP note
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/460089">460089</a> if you were not using this
feature yet.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>General remarks</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
3.1.0 and 3.1.1 were early versions of JCo 3.1 that were used in restricted use cases only: within SAP Cloud Platform
and embedded into a small set of SAP tools.
